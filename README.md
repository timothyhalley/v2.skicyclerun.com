## Testing

End-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://cypress.io). Test script located in repo under --> `/cypress/integration/tests.js`.

To run tests, first make sure your dev server is running with `gridsome develop`. I'm assuming you're using the default port of 8080. If not, change the `baseUrl` key in the `cypress.json` file.

After your dev server is running, you can run `npm run test` or `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open` to start Cypress. The Cypress electron app will run. Click the `tests.js` file and the tests will run in an automated browser.

npx cypress would do the trick here... need to validate this hunch.
